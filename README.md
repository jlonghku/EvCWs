Main usage
Through the summary of current literatures, the responses of constructed welands under changing natural hydrological and aritificial hydraulic conditions are surveyed to help engineerings to preview the situation in different constructed wetlands. 
Installation required:
Install Python
Install Numpy, QtCore through "pip install numpy pyqt5"
Userage(This is a draft version now):
In the options of types, some template of common used constructed wetlands were provided if the type was chosen and click the Apply button. Users can also define their own parameters of condtructed wetlands by the input interface below.
After the input of all concerned parameters, choose suiable changing hydraulic and hydrological conditions and click the Evaluate button, the possible responses of constrcuted wetlands to the changing conditions could be calculated.
